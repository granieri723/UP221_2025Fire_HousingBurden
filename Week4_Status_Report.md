# **Post-Wildfire Housing Burden Impacts**
### *While we plan to have a collaborative approach to this project, here is a tentative layout of our main roles and responsibilities given our strengths.*
#### **Bryzen** - "Mapping Specialist," create/code maps relevant to our analysis
#### **Elizabeth** - "Presentation Designer," create supporting diagrams/images for our presentation that will support our analysis
#### **Leo** - Presentation Designer 2," create and organize presentation materials into slides
#### **Gina** - "Storyteller," develop narrative structure and create a comprehensive storyline

### Status Update
We are excited about our research topic, but also stressed and nervous about how we will put it all together. One thing that is working well is our weekly meetings to discuss the project and next steps. Maybe one thing that needs to be clarified is the specific data sets we are working with and what we plan to do with them. 

### Data Update
We have started mapping the data listed in our project scope which can be found in our group repository.

### Concerns
Major concerns: 
1. Suggested so many data sets, hard to create narrative around it
2. Also trying to put in dimension of price gouging
3. If and how we should use the price gouging data, would be cool to map spreadsheet

Minor concerns:
1. To what extent are we supposed to be analyzing/editing the maps
