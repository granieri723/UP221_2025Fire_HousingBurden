**Project Brief**

In times of crises, prices for essential goods often increase significantly due to sudden high demand and limited supply also known as ‘price gouging’ ([Snyder 2009](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27673275?searchText=price+gouging+california&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dprice%2Bgouging%2Bcalifornia%26so%3Drel&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_search_gsv2%2Fcontrol&refreqid=fastly-default%3A674988539685059d6d4361d3bdea7592&seq=1)). Following the Pacific Palisades and Altadena wildfires, rental prices in Los Angeles County have increased by more than 10% according to Chelsea Kirk, a tenant organizer for Strategic Actions for a Just Economy (SAJE); a Zillow listing in Bel Air listed at $15,900 per month in September 2024 now stands at $29,500 per month, an almost 86% increase ([Burns 2025](https://inthesetimes.com/article/price-gouging-wildfires-los-angeles-landlords)). 

Through this exploration of housing burden and rental price gouging data, we hope to answer the following questions: ***what are the characteristics (social, economic, etc) of affected communities in the Pacific Palisades and Altadena that make them vulnerable to price gouging? How does price gouging relate to the wildfires in LA (i.e., do landlords increase their rents more as they see the natural disaster continue)?***

As Los Angeles Residents and renters, we have a personal stake in the housing market. If landlords raise rents as a result of the fire we may be impacted alongside members of our community. The analysis performed could inform policy decisions related to wildfire recovery and rent caps. A better understanding of the wildfire impacts across LA's rental markets could improve policy solutions and ensure that landlords who engage in price gouging are held accountable. 

Natural disasters have often created an environment in which landlords, private equity, developers and others can take advantage of unique market conditions to make a lot of money at the expense of affected residents. This dynamic is well documented--Naomi Klein wrote an entire book on it--and it will occur more frequently as climate change impacts intensify. The recent LA wildfires affected a wide range of communities. All of a sudden, thousands of people need long term rental housing at a moment when supply has significantly decreased. As documented by Strategic Actions for a Just Economy, landlords have taken advantage of this dynamic and illegally raised rental prices across LA. Some of the people who were displaced (wealthy residents of Pacific Palisades, for example) can afford these increases but many others cannot. Displaced residents will not be the only ones affected. Anyone looking for housing right now will face a tighter, more expensive housing market than they would have just a month or two ago. It is possible that rental price gouging may have a disproportionate impact on economically or demographically vulnerable people and deepen inequities in LA County.  

Our focus area is Los Angeles County. Although housing markets outside of LA County may be affected by changes caused by recent fires we are most interested in the places people moved to immediately after being displaced by fires and how that movement affected rental markets. LA county is a notoriously expensive place to live, so any factor that could increase housing costs is concerning to us. We want to analyze the entire county to assess if rents changed across the board or if specific areas were more affected than others (eg. areas closer to fires, low income neighborhoods). Our time frame is relatively short, observing “Pre-fire” rents versus “post-fire” rents so we will be looking at essentially just two points in time rather than continuous temporal data. 

**Data Sources**

The organization Strategic Actions for a Just Economy has been tracking rental price gouging through a crowdsourced spreadsheet. We’ll use this data to observe where price gouging has occurred. We will also use ACS data to understand neighborhood demographic composition.

The goal for this project is to identify the socio-economic characteristics of neighborhoods most impacted by rental price gouging, such as housing burden, race, and income. We hope to gain an understanding of where rental price gouging is most likely to occur in the immediate aftermath of the fires and which demographic groups are most impacted by this behavior. We will also create a graphic representation of where neighborhoods at high risk for price gouging are located based on the results of our analysis.
