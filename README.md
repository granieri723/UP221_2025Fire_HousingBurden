**An introduction of your research question**

How have exploitative housing pricing practices in the aftermath of the Pacific Palisades and Altadena wildfires disproportionately impacted communities of color within Los Angeles County?

Immediately following the wildfires , many landlords in LA County dramatically increased rental prices. Across the affected communities in Pacific Palisades and Altadena, what are the characteristics of these neighborhoods that make them vulnerable to price gouging? How does price gouging relate to the wildfires in LA (i.e., do landlords increase their rents more as they see the natural disaster continue)? 

**An explanation of why it is important to you, why it matters to others, and what is at stake**

Why is this important to us?
We’re residents of LA and renters. If landlords raise rents as a result of the fire we may be affected along with members of our community.

Why does this matter to others?
This research could inform policy decisions related to wildfire recovery and rent caps. A better understanding of the wildfire impacts across LA's rental markets could improve policy solutions and ensure that landlords who engage in price gouging are held accountable. 

**What is at stake?**

Natural disasters have often created an environment in which landlords, private equity, developers and others can take advantage of unique market conditions to make a lot of money at the expense of affected residents. This dynamic is well documented--Naomi Klein wrote an entire book on it--and it will occur more frequently as climate change impacts intensify. The recent LA wildfires affected a wide range of communities. All of a sudden, thousands of people need long term rental housing at a moment when supply has significantly decreased. As documented by Strategic Actions for a Just Economy, landlords have taken advantage of this dynamic and illegaly raised rental prices across LA. Some of the people who were displaced (wealthy residents of Pacific Palisades, for example) can afford these increases but many others cannot. Displaced residents will not be the only one's affected, though. Anyone looking for housing right now will face a tighter, more expensive housing market than they would have just a month or two ago. It is possible that rental price gouging may have a disproportionate impact on economically or demographically vulnerable people and deepen inequities in LA County.  

**A description of the spatial scope (e.g. Boyle Heights or Hong Kong), and why space and/or time matters for your project**

Our focus area is Los Angeles County. Although housing markets outside of LA County may be affected by changes caused by recent fires we are most interested in the places people moved to immediately after being displaced by fires and how that movement affected rental markets. LA county is a notoriously expensive place to live, so any factor that could increase housing costs is concerning to us. 
We want to analyze the entire county to assess if rents changed across the board or if specific areas were more affected than others (eg. areas closer to fires, low income neighborhoods). 

Our time frame is relatively short--we want to observe “Pre-fire” rents versus “post-fire” rents so we'll be looking at essentially just two points in time rather than continuous temporal data. 

**A preliminary but definitive description of data sources (at least two) that you will use**

The organization Strategic Actions for a Just Economy has been tracking rental price gouging through a crowdsourced spreadsheet. We’ll use this data to observe where price gouging has occurred. We'll also use ACS data to understand neighborhood demographic composition.

**A concluding paragraph of what insights you expect to gain from your research**

We hope to gain a understanding of where rental price gouging was most likely to occur in the immediate aftermath of the fires and which demographic groups were most impacted by this behavior. We will also create a graphic representation of where neighborhoods at high risk for price gouging are located based on the results of our analysis.
